# Kigen Engine

Kigen is a game engine based on [lwjgl](https://www.lwjgl.org/) written in Clojure.


## Installation

FIXME:

## Usage

Use ```lein with-profile <platform-name> <command-to-run>```. For example, to run the project in macos I use:

```Bash
lein with-profile macos-arm64 run
```

Note: The framework has only support for macos-arm64 at the moment. The support for other platforms is coming soon.
